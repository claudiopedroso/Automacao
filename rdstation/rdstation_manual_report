7. Bugs and Recommendations  

7.1 Registration Screen - https://app-staging.rdstation.com.br/cadastro
7.1.1 Recommendation: When the customer fills the zip code field, the page could automatically fill Street, City and State fields.
7.1.2 Recommendation: After failing to create an account, the page removes the info typed in the name and job title fields. It could keep the information in those fields, that hold no sensitive data.
7.1.3 Bug: When trying to register as a natural/legal person, when I fill all required fields (/screenshots/Registration_page_filled.png) 
and click create account, I get an error message (/screenshots/registration_error.png). No field is highlighted. Expected Result: Account creation successful
