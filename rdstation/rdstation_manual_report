7. Bugs and Recommendations
System-wide
  Recommendation: Standardize popup notification style. In some screens the system uses a custom one (red background and red font), in others it uses the browser default.

Registration Screen - https://app-staging.rdstation.com.br/cadastro
  Recommendation: When the customer fills the zip code field, the page could automatically fill Street, City and State fields.
  Recommendation: After failing to create an account, the page removes the info typed in the name and job title fields. It could keep the information in those fields, that hold no sensitive data.
  Bug: When trying to register as a natural/legal person, when I fill all required fields (/screenshots/Registration_page_filled.png)
and click create account, I get an error message (/screenshots/registration_error.png). No field is highlighted. Expected Result: Account creation successful

Attract > Keywords page - https://app-staging.rdstation.com.br/palavras-chave
  Recommendation: Change the "Export to Excel" button name to "Export to csv" or add the option to export to xls/xlsx

Attract > Blog tools - https://app-staging.rdstation.com.br/blog
  Bug: The "Request Blog" button hyperlink is broken - Error 404 (/screenshots/blog_quotation_404.png)
  Bug: Generating a suggestion with long words without spaces breaks the page layout (/screenshots/line_break.png)
